    Wishing you a birthday filled with love, joy, and all the happiness you bring to the people around you. I’m beyond grateful for our friendship, and I already know this next year is gonna be another unforgettable one.  

    First off, I hope you receive all the love today because you deserve every bit of it. Just wanted to take a second to say thank you, not just for today, but for always being like a sister to me. From the late-night FT calls to the funniest venting sessions, it’s always a vibe. You let me troll and not take things too seriously, and honestly, I appreciate that more than you know. The advice, the laughs, the support—it all means a lot.  

    And thank you for allowing me to be an uncle twice. Your bunny and kitten really made my resume go up. You already know I take my role seriously.  

    And because I truly value this friendship, I had to do something special. So, I coded this whole website just for you. That’s real love right there. Friendship on a different level, twin.  

    Life be doing its thing, but through it all, I’m grateful for this bond we’ve built. No matter what, I got you, just like you’ve always had me.  

    So today, we celebrating, laughing, and making some more memories. Much love, fam. Get lit for me today 🕺🏿🕺🏿 BIG 21!!!!`;
